                <p>The foreign exchange market (Forex, FX, or currency market) is a global decentralized or over-the-counter (OTC) market for 
                    the trading of currencies. This market determines foreign exchange rates for every currency. It includes all aspects of 
                    buying, selling and exchanging currencies at current or determined prices. The foreign exchange market assists international 
                    trade and investments by enabling currency conversion. For example, it permits a business in the United States to import 
                    goods from European Union member states, especially Eurozone members, and pay Euros, even though its income is in United 
                    States dollars. It also supports direct speculation and evaluation relative to the value of currencies and the carry trade 
                    speculation, based on the differential interest rate between two currencies.</p>

                <h1>What is traded on forex?</h1>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>The simple answer to that question is money. Forex trading is the simultaneous buying of one currency and selling of another. 
                    Apart from money, forex market is large enough to accommodate many commodities. </p>

                <h1>Who is a forex broker?</h1>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>A broker is a firm that gives us access to the financial market. Before the invent of forex broker, forex market was meant 
                    for large financial institutions like central banks of all countries and later commercial banks and rich men with which 
                    they use huge amount of money like millions of dollars. Forex broker makes it possible for me and you no matter your 
                    country, state of origin, background, financial status to trade this highly liquid market. They give us access to forex 
                    market and provide us with what they called leverage.  Because of retail broker anyone can now trade the forex market. 
                    Before the invent of retail brokers for you to place a forex order, the central bank has to place a call to the regulatory 
                    bodies before they can transact but with forex broker, we can basically be on our bed and place a forex order with our MT4(Meta Trader 4).</p>

            <div>
                <p>There are two forms of trading, we have fundamental analyses and technical analyses.

                    factors like: export and import indices, political stability of a country, strength of a country’s economy, employment rate, 
                    any trade war between countries, local violence within the country, any ongoing election etc . All these affect the economy 
                    and the value of the currency of that particular economy.

                    close price is below the open.</p>
